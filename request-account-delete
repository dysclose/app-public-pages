# Deleting personal data

There are two ways to delte your personal data from our platform.

# Option 1 - Deleting only the integrations

2. Delete all integrations

Your email and name will still be stored after this process, and you will be able to create new integrations again.

Send an e-mail to admin@dysclose.com asking for the full deletion.

All your data, including email and name, will be deleted within 10 business days.
